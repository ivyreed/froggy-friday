## UI
(all of these are more template. if buck wants to change any of this that is fine)

Title Screen
  - level select
  - options?? (are we even going to have any options?)
  - credits

Level select area
  - levels
  - back 

Pause screen
  - continue
  - restart level
  - homescreen

complete level screen
  - next level
  - back to menu

HUD
  - tokens
  - area for narrators voice should be seperate from tokens

no death scene. they will die a lot later on. it will just get in the way.

## Mechanics

Charachter movement
  - coyote timer
  - jump bufffer
  - ledge hop

get parallax code working

get next level once hit finish working

implement achievments(later goal. not priority)

mayyybeee add a new trap/mechanic for later on

OHH ice would be a cool thing

probably need a  lot more things here but im not gonna worrie about that

## WorldBuilding
levels will be prety tall with author completion times ranging from 3-7 minutes depending on how hard the puzzles gets with no checkpoints
  - reason for this being it will be a mix between rage/muscle memory and puzzle solving
  - this can ideally get us to have a new player game completion time of over an hour with just 6 ish levels (assuming it takes multiple tries to beat each level)

## Story

Flush out narrators charachter and reasonings

Flush out a semblance of a story or reasoning between level transitions... if there is one. maybe we can embrace the chaos and randomness and forgo this step

buck is the genious when it comes to bringing a story to life through storytelling. this is more your area

## Assets

(all of these are more template. if philip wants to change pix size, ammount of frames, etc that is fine)

decide on a program to use

  > note: aseprite seems very popular for this

decide level pallets
  > note: if all lvl 1 assets are made, we can just re-color the assets with different pallets per level with minor changes.  

Charachter (32pix)
  - concept art(can be sketch)
  - base model (pixelated)
  - static charachter made
  - idle animation(8ish frames)
  - running animation(8ish frames)
  - jumping animation(1 frame)
  - falling animation(1 frame)

Mirror(32pix)
  - concept art(can be sketch)
  - static charahter made
  - idle animation(8ish frames)
  - running animation(8ish frames)
  - jumping animation(1 frame)
  - falling animation(1 frame)

Token(16pix)
  - idle animation(8ish frames)

Finish zone
  - idk a big ass bouy or something(48 pix)

ground(48pix)
  - level 1 grass and dirt
  - level 2 icy tundra(this is an example. idk whats happenin on level 2 thats for philip to decide)
  - etc etc

Traps
  - 16 pix small trap(spikes or beartrap etc)
  - 48pix big trap(saw blade or big axe blade etc)

Platforms
  - 16 pix canvas, the platform will be thin like only 3 ish pixels

exe favicon
  - game icon for executable 

parallax background(ivy)
  - 4-5 layers per level
    * wall(16pix)
    * wall side(16pix)
    * foreground trees(32 or 16 slight anti-ailiased)
    * midground clouds(32 anti-aliased)
    * background sky (slight different colors maybe gradient y axis)(blurred)
  - the side layer will eventually replace the side walls

parallax mice flood(ivy)(for level 3)

## SoundEffects

oh god we need music 

and collision sound

will need more research

## Misc
set up github license

implement achievements

## Goals
ideally would like to have 1-3 levels close enough to completion to create demo/trailer and steam page by 3/15
